# Hand Gesture Analysis Platform

A web application that lets users build and use custom hand gesture recognition models. Users train models on their own gestures by uploading videos, then analyze new videos to generate transcripts of recognized gestures.

## Features
- Custom gesture training: define gestures by name and upload training videos
- Model management: create and manage multiple gesture dictionaries per account
- Video analysis: run a trained model against a video to produce a gesture transcript
- Transcript history: browse and query saved transcripts with confidence scores

# Project Setup

Please refer to the [sample project setup instructions here](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-304/resources/javascript-oracle-resources/node-setup.html#remote-deploy-item) for more in-depth instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Access to UBC CS undergrad server

## Setup Instructions (Remote)

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following contents:

```
# TODO: Edit the values below this line according to the given placeholders
# Replace 'ora_YOUR-CWL-USERNAME' with "ora_" (no quotation marks) followed by your CWL username.
ORACLE_USER=ora_YOUR-CWL-USERNAME
# Replace 'YOUR-STUDENT-NUMBER' with your actual student number.
ORACLE_PASS=aYOUR-STUDENT-NUMBER


#Adjust the PORT if needed (e.g., if you encounter a "port already occupied" error)
PORT=65535

# -------------- The three lines below should be left unaltered --------------
ORACLE_HOST=dbhost.students.cs.ubc.ca
ORACLE_PORT=1522
ORACLE_DBNAME=stu

```
test

### 2. Configure Team Number
**Only perform this step if you want to run the project on the remote servers**

Open the `remote-start.sh` script and set your team number:

```bash
TEAM_NUMBER=... # Replace ... with your actual team number here
```

# Project Info

This project runs as one service:
- FastAPI backend (`backend/`)
- React frontend build served by FastAPI (`frontend/dist`)

Update `.env` values:
- `ORACLE_USER`
- `ORACLE_PASS`
- `PORT` (for web app)
- `ORACLE_HOST`, `ORACLE_PORT`, `ORACLE_DBNAME`

To run the application, no libraries needed. Run ./scripts/deploy.sh to deploy site and go to localhost:port_number.

To updated the ui, npm needs to be installed. Once installed, running ./scripts/build-frontend.sh will update the files in frontend/dist. This will update the ui for everyone.

If using a machine not on the student servers, use bash scripts/mac/db-tunnel.sh to connect to the oracle database. Or use bash scripts/win/db-tunnel.cmd.
